                <p class="text-muted text-left"> The social organisation in ancient Greece was initially quite simple. You were either a free man, a foreigner, or a slave, depending on your status. Three major socioeconomic classes can be seen in the Greek city-state of Sparta: native Spartans, who controlled politics and the military; free foreigners, who controlled trade and communication with other towns; and the Helots, who were Spartan slaves. However, as Greek society, particularly in Athens, evolved, so did the social classes and the overall organisation of society. We'll focus on Athenian society for the rest of this lesson, even though other city-states in ancient Greece  </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> A house was built around an open air courtyard throughout most of ancient Greece. Stone, wood, and clay bricks were used to construct homes. They were both durable and comfy to wear. Larger residences may include multiple bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a woman's sitting space, a men's dining room, and one or two storage rooms. They had small, non-glass windows with wooden shutters to keep the blazing sun out. There wasn't a lot of furniture inside. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Ancient Romans wore two types of basic garments, tunics, and togas. Tunics were informal and indoor costumes, while togas were formal and outdoor costumes. Both were made of spun wool. Tunic was comfortable for working and moving around indoors. Mostly white in colour, the tunic was often undyed, and plain. Still, the upper-class people wore tunics with some decorations to distinguish themselves from the slaves. Togas were taken from the Greek fashion. It was an important garment and an indicator of roman citizenship. No outsiders were allowed to wear a toga even though they lived in Italy or Rome. Toga was the official garment of both men and woman of Rome. Later the trend changed, and togas were worn only by male Roman citizens. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> In the cities of Ancient Rome lived in apartments called insulae. The wealthy lived-in single-family homes called domus of various sizes depending on how rich they were. The vast majority of the people living in Roman cities lived in cramped apartment buildings called insulae. Insulae were generally three to five stories high and housed from 30 to 50 people. The individual apartments usually consisted of two small rooms. They could be dangerous places if they caught fire and sometimes even collapsed. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> The plebeians and the patricians were the two separate classes of Roman citizens. The patricians were members of the aristocratic class. Everyone else was referred to as a plebe. The patricians were the early Roman Empire's ruling elite. The Roman republic is divided into three sections. There are patricians, peasants, and slaves among them. The patricians are the most powerful and wealthy members of society. </p>
